# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

my notes

What are each of these files and folders for?

README.md is a markdown file that includes a lot of helpful tips and links that can help you while learning to use Create React App.
node_modules is a folder that includes all of the dependency-related code that Create React App has installed. You will never need to go into this folder.
package.json that manages our app dependencies and what is included in our node_modules folder for our project, plus the scripts we need to run our app.
.gitignore is a file that is used to exclude files and folders from being tracked by Git. We don't want to include large folders such as the node_modules folder
public is a folder that we can use to store our static assets, such as images, svgs, and fonts for our React app.
src is a folder that contains our source code. It is where all of our React-related code will live and is what we will primarily work in to build our app.
